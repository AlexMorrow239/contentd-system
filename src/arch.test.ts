 * Repo-wide architecture lints: assertions about how modules may depend on
 * each other, rather than about any module's behavior.
 *
 * They live in their own file because they are import-heavy by nature — the
 * thing being guarded is usually "module A must not reach for module B at
 * runtime", which the guard itself can only check by importing B. Kept inside
 * a behavior test file, that cost lands on every run of a file that has no
 * other reason to pay it.
